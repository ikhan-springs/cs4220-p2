# CS 4220 Project 2

This repository contains my work for Project 2 for the course CS 4220: Computer Networks.

CS 4220 focuses on the basic network and protocol concepts and principles with practical hands-on exercises on network management, network programming, and network planning through the use of industry simulators. Topics include internet protocols and routing, local area networks, basic TCP/IP programming, congestion control, packet switching and routing, quality-of-service, and network management.

I completed this course at UCCS in May 2021.

This project demonstrates a simple TCP socket program between a client and a server.
